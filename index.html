                About a year ago, I was hanging out with my friend, Luke. He and I were discussing relationships and he was talking about a friend of his that he had looked up to for a long time. Luke’s friend and his wife had taken him in to have a place to stay while he was going to school. He looked up to the husband as a spiritual leader and friend. But things always look differently when you spend time with the people you look up to and put on a pedestal. Eventually, the relationship turned sour. He was hurt and felt unfairly treated and despite the good he thought could still come from maintaining that relationship and staying with them, he decided it would be best to leave and find a place on his own. When he told me this story, he said he felt God telling him to “leave the dead”. When he said those words, I lit up! Those words were exactly what I needed to describe what I was going through with several relationships in my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                At the time, I had started deconstructing my Christian faith. I was struggling with what I believed was a huge disconnect between American Evangelicalism and Christianity as it relates to the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. I had still been struggling with my divorce 7 years prior to that despite having been re-married for 4 years. There were a few friends that I had known my whole life that, although I didn’t want them out of my life, I wanted their influence out, or lessened. And then there was family whose influence I needed to lessen as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                After Luke and I were near the end of hanging out, I couldn’t get those 3 words out of my head. I told him what it meant to me and asked if I could use it to make a blog and buy this domain. He graciously gave me permission to do so. As much as I love the name, I do have to give credit to him for introducing it to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                So what’s this blog all about? I wanted to share my experiences in relationships of all kinds over the years, and hopefully use that to help others leave dead relationships. Or to help bring a little bit of life back into them. This isn’t a relationship blog, per se. I’m not a relationship professional. I’m not a therapist (licensed or unlicensed). I’m not an expert in this field aside from the fact that I, like you, have been in relationships in the past, am currently in many relationships now, and expect to be in new ones in the future. These range from friends, to families, to romantic, to even relationships with organizations such as religious groups/organizations, work/job, volunteer groups, hobby groups, whatever relationship in which you have to interact with another person.
                </p>
                <p>
                Due to the personal nature of this topic with individuals, this can bring up a wide array of emotions to anybody reading this. Because of that, I am not allowing for any direct, public interaction one might normally find with a blog. But I did want a way for people to get in touch if they needed someone to just vent to or talk with. So I created <a href="mailto:hello@leavethedead.com">hello@leavethedead.com</a> for you to send me any emails. And if you want to call and leave a voicemail, you can ring me at ‪(650) 731-5683‬. Please do not provide your full name if you don’t feel comfortable. Nothing you say nor any part of the recordings will be used in a public manner. Nobody else will hear it except me when I check it, and then it’s gone forever. You can also text at that number if that feels safer. I will respond to those as time allows.
                </p>
                <p>
                Although I’m not a professional counselor, I will try and report to the authorities any threats to harm one’s self or others if I have the means to do so. Please seek professional help if you or someone you know are in immediate danger. Call 9-1-1. Call a trusted friend or family member. Please take care of yourself and your fellow humans as best as you can. The idea of this whole experiment is to build each other up. As I meet with people and learn more about programs and opportunities in other states, I hope to have a page that will help people find resources to help them in their area.
                </p>
                <p>
                If I find it valuable to open up comments or other methods of direct interaction with me and other readers, I will consider that in the future. But for now, I’m more concerned with your anonymity, safety, and ability to share your voice with someone if you can’t afford a therapist at this time. Again, I’m not a therapist, nor do I claim to be one. I just want to be an ear for those who need one, and someone you can bounce ideas off of in a safe and quasi-anonymous format.
                </p>
                <p>
                Thank you and let’s start building each other up!
                </p>
